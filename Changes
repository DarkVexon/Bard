Blink -> Exhaust, upgrades to Exhaustive 2.
This card is relatively on the par of Intangible, especially with the Green Note
it grants easily enabling block on top of its insane reduction.
Not to mention Bard's easy Weak access.
A 1-turn effect matches "blink" more,
and upgrading to Exhaustive 2 means it can tank out
two big boss turns.

Buckler Bash -> 4 Block Loss. Block Loss does not change on upgrade.
This allows me to use Block(s) and cash in the Block from it to utilize Buckler Bash.
Should make it mildly more effective.

Faerie Fire -> Common.
Hideous Laughter -> Uncommon.
Swapping these makes sense, as Faerie Fire is more of a common.
Hideous Laughter is a rare and very useful single debuff note,
on top of trigger pretty much all synergies,
so it makes sense to have it at Uncommon.

False Life -> 8(9) on-play Temp HP.
While this card doesn't have the explosive possibility of Phantasmal, it grants a lot of temp HP.
Tuning down its base numbers just a little to make the synergy the more key aspect.

First Strike -> 10 damage upgraded, increases First Strike damage on upgrade
This is just for me to have fun.

Haste+ -> Exhaustive 2
This should incentivise getting at least 2 Dex before popping the first play. I love this card, but the upgraded form scales to a win.
Bard's rares offer a lot of defensive options.

Heroism -> 4(6) Temporary HP
This card is a huge pile of good stuff. You can get both Temp. HP and Block(s) easily, as well as a burst of Inspiration.
The blue-green combo is useful in general, with a leading green for scaling.
Not to mention it can make half a Divine Protection.
Lowering the Temp HP should help.

Improv -> 4(3) Notes required
Improv is relatively useless. This is my first try at increasing its viability -
if this fails, I'd be interested in seeing if a wildnote-related card would be alright.
Even if it was just "Queue 1(2) [wildnote]." Maybe it could even have no text.
After some gameplay, I'm pretty sold on this. It feels strong, but good.
it could maybe get Exhaust. And it might be a little too similar to Rhapsody, honestly...

Life Drain -> 10 damage, Exhaust(Exhaustive 2)
Life Drain is still super strong.
The Inspiration deck already increases Block, and capitalizing on that
with actual block cards should be the way to generate
most of the defense.
It's also just a generally pretty strong card, honestly.
Making it Exhaust means a heavily Inspiration focused deck may want to
wait, or use actual Inspiration Melodies, to buff up the card with good timing.
Exhaustive 2 is a nice upgrade now.

Off-Key -> 7(9) effects
Off-Key- was never worth taking, whereas if you had a camp ahead it was a key pick.
This should make the base effect a little better even with Riposte existing,
as well as nerfing the upgrade's huge swing.

Power Word: Stun -> Exhaustive 2
Same effects,
no more than 2 stuns.

Quick Song -> 0 cost base, 5(8) Block.
Bard didn't have any 0 cost block cards, and I thought that was by design
until I realized this UPGRADES 0 cost.
I like the idea of the card, and being 0 cost base
would make it a lot pickable unupgraded. So I made it 0 base,
and upgrades to add the 3 block.

Tiny Hut -> 6 Block base
Just to make it a little easier to take.

Divine Protection -> 7 Temp. HP.
Just to sliiiightly lower it.
Also because 7 is often considered a 
Divine Number.

Feast on Fear -> 5(7) Block.
Swaps Block amounts with Tiny Hut.
Reasoning: This has its own built in Vuln melody (and generally better notes),
whereas Tiny Hut doesn't have any built-ins.
Not to mention, just a general effort to slightly lower the TEMP HP numbers.

Shifting+ -> 15 on each effect
The upgrade is a huge swing, and generally I find this card doesn't scale as crazily unless you get the upgrade. This is a tiny tune but it probably means a little bit.
