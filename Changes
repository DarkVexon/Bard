Blink -> 2 cost. Alternatives/additions would be removing the green note, or nerfing the upgrade to 2->1 cost.
Reason: The card is an overpowering defensive option that heavilly neutralizes enemy attacks.
I like the design and I don't want to change the effect too much, so I simply bumped the cost up.
Adding Exhaust would be another direction that I wouldn't mind.
I want the Rare damage mitigation options to stay relevant.

Buckler Bash -> 4 Block Loss. Block Loss does not change on upgrade.
This allows me to use Block(s) and cash in the Block from it to utilize Buckler Bash.
Should make it mildly more effective.

Faerie Fire -> Retain.
Faerie Fire has a sick animation, and a good effect.
It's hard to use reliably compared to Bard's common debuff options.
I also find it hard to justify its uncommon rarity.
Adding Retain makes the Vulnerable more consistently relevant. The double debuff note is frequently a downside,
so I think this is okay.

False Life -> 8(9) on-play Temp HP.
While this card doesn't have the explosive possibility of Feast on Fear, it grants a lot of temp HP.
Tuning down its numbers just a little.

First Strike -> 10 damage upgraded, increases First Strike damage on upgrade
This is just for me to have fun.

Haste+ -> Exhaustive 2
This should incentivise getting at least 2 Dex before popping the first play. I love this card, but the upgraded form scales fast.
Bard's rares offer a lot of defensive options.

Heroism -> 4(6) Temporary HP
This card is a huge pile of good stuff. You can get both Temp. HP and Block(s) easily, as well as a burst of Inspiration.
The blue-green combo is useful in general, with a leading green for scaling.
Not to mention it can make half a Divine Protection.
Lowering the Temp HP should help.

Improv -> 4(3) Notes required
Improv is basically useless. This is my first try at increasing its viability -
if this fails, I'd be interested in seeing if a wildnote-related card would be alright.
Even if it was just "Queue 1(2) [wildnote]." Maybe it could even have no text.

Life Drain -> Ethereal, 8(10) damage
Life Drain is still super strong.
The Inspiration deck already increases Block, and capitalizing on that
with cards like Guard Point should be a key way to get defence.
Scaling out of control is okay, but I think Life Drain should
continue to carry some risk of some sort.
Adding Ethereal means you have to weight if you picked enough
high-value defense to allow playing it and keeping the temp HP over
between turns, especially early.

Off-Key -> 7(9) effects
Off-Key- was never worth taking, whereas if you had a camp ahead it was a key pick.
This should make the base effect a little better even with Riposte existing,
as well as nerfing the upgrade's huge swing.
