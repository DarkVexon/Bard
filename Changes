Blink -> 2 cost. Alternatives/additions would be removing the green note, or nerfing the upgrade to 2->1 cost.
Reason: The card is an overpowering defensive option that heavilly neutralizes enemy attacks.
I like the design and I don't want to change the effect too much, so I simply bumped the cost up.
Adding Exhaust would be another direction that I wouldn't mind.
I want the Rare damage mitigation options to stay relevant.

Buckler Bash -> 4 Block Loss. Block Loss does not change on upgrade.
This allows me to use Block(s) and cash in the Block from it to utilize Buckler Bash.
Should make it mildly more effective.

Faerie Fire -> Retain.
Faerie Fire has a sick animation, and a good effect.
It's hard to use reliably compared to Bard's common debuff options.
I also find it hard to justify its uncommon rarity.
Adding Retain makes the Vulnerable more consistently relevant. The double debuff note is frequently a downside,
so I think this is okay.

False Life -> 8(9) on-play Temp HP.
While this card doesn't have the explosive possibility of Feast on Fear, it grants a lot of temp HP.
Tuning down its numbers just a little.

First Strike -> 10 damage upgraded, increases First Strike damage on upgrade
This is just for me to have fun.

Haste+ -> Exhaustive 2
This should incentivise getting at least 2 Dex before popping the first play. I love this card, but the upgraded form scales fast.
Bard's rares offer a lot of defensive options.
